In the future, we will have a way to add custom SOS Cards! But hold up, there! Only the devs can add cards to the entire server. But what about the creative minds out there that want to contribute? Simply submit a pull request on the GitHub with your SOS entries written in a text file, and we'll code it! However, to make sure things are mostly clean, SOS cards with vulgar names will not be considered.
